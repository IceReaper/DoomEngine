# DoomEngine

DoomEngine is a fork of [Managed Doom](https://github.com/sinshu/managed-doom) by 田中信秋 (sinshu) focused on splitting engine, gamescript and platform for modability, custom games and modern enhancements without the focus on keeping it as close as possible to the original.
Playing the original games will always be supported, however gameplay experience may slightly differ.
